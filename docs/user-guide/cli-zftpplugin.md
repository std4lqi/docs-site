## Create a User Profile
You can create a `zftp` user profile to avoid typing your connection details on every command. A `zftp` profile contains the host, port, username, and password for the z/OS you will connect. You can create multiple profiles and switch between them as needed.

**Follow these steps:**
1.  Create a zftp profile: 
    ```
    zowe profiles create zftp <profile name> -H <host> -u <user> -p <password> -P <port>
    zowe profiles create zftp <profile name> -H <host> -u <user> -p <password> -P <port> --secure-ftp true
    ```
    The result of the command displays as a success or failure message. You can use your profile when you issue commands in the zftp command group. 
    
**Note:** The option `--secure-ftp true` is strongly recommended, if FTPS (FTP over SSL) is enabled in z/OS FTP service. , It's not SFTP (FTP over SSH).

**Note:** For more information about the syntax, actions, and options, for a profiles create command, open Zowe CLI and issue the following command:

```
zowe profiles create zftp -h
```
